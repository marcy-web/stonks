numpy vs standard arrays:
    - numpy is 10-100 times faster
    - more memory efficient
    - can perform operations on arrays without loops

bad variable names because...? math background maybe?

starting the game:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv ~/venvs/ascii

# Activate it
source ~/venvs/ascii/bin/activate

# Install the package
pip install asciichartpy
