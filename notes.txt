numpy vs standard arrays:
    - numpy is 10-100 times faster
    - more memory efficient
    - can perform operations on arrays without loops

bad variable names because...? math background maybe?

volatility ** 2 / 2 what that bit basically does is make sure our predictions are correct long term, even though there's lots of noise in the short term
deterministic = predictable, stochastic = random

starting the game:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv ~/venvs/ascii

# Activate it
source ~/venvs/ascii/bin/activate

# Install the package
pip install asciichartpy


to-do:
- add biases
- pull data from y finance
